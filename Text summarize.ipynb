    "1. Introduction\n",
    "i.IDBI Bank is one of India's largest commercial Banks. For over 50 years, IDBI Bank has essayed a key nation-building role, first as the apex Development Financial Institution (DFI) (July 1, 1964 to September 30, 2004) in the realm of industry and thereafter as a full-service commercial Bank (October 1, 2004 onwards). As a DFI, the erstwhile Industrial Development Bank of India stretched its canvas beyond mere project financing to cover an array of services that contributed towards balanced geographical spread of industries, development of identified backward areas, emergence of a new spirit of enterprise and evolution of a deep and vibrant capital market. On October 1, 2004, the erstwhile Industrial Development Bank of India converted into a Banking company, as Industrial Development Bank of India Limited (IDBI Ltd.) to undertake the entire gamut of banking activities while continuing to play its secular DFI role. Post the mergers of the erstwhile IDBI Bank Limited with its parent company (IDBI Ltd.) on April 2, 2005 and the subsequent merger of the erstwhile United Western Bank Ltd. with IDBI Bank on October 3, 2006, the tech-savvy, new generationBank with majority Government shareholding today touches the lives of millions of Indians through an array of corporate, retail, SME and Agri products and services. Life Insurance Copration of Inida (LICI) have acquired 51% shareholding in IDBI Bank on Jan 21, 2019 and have become the promoter of IDBI Bank.\n",
